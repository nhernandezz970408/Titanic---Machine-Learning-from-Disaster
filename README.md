# Kaggle Competition: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains my solution to the famous [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) competition on Kaggle. The project includes two main components:

1. An **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Notebook** to understand the dataset and uncover patterns.
2. A **Model Exploration Notebook** to evaluate different machine learning models and tune their performance.

## Overview

The Titanic competition is a beginner-friendly machine learning challenge where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on various features such as age, gender, class, etc.

## Competition Details

- **Platform:** Kaggle
- **Evaluation Metric:** Accuracy
- **Goal:** Predict the `Survived` label (1 for survived, 0 for did not survive)
